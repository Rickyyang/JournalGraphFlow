	abstract = {One of the fundamental problems in sensor networks is to estimate and track the state of targets (or dynamic processes) of interest that evolve in the sensing field. Kalman filtering has been an effective algorithm for tracking dynamic processes for over four decades. Distributed Kalman Filtering (DKF) involves design of the information processing algorithm of a network of estimator agents with a two-fold objective: (1) estimate the state of the target of interest and (2) reach a consensus with neighboring estimator agents on the state estimate. We refer to this DKF algorithm as Kalman-Consensus Filter (KCF). The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) finding the optimal decentralized Kalman-Consensus filter and showing that its computational and communication costs are not scalable in n and (ii) introducing a scalable suboptimal Kalman-Consensus Filter and providing a formal stability and performance analysis of this distributed and cooperative filtering algorithm. Kalman-Consensus Filtering algorithm is applicable to sensor networks with variable topology including mobile sensor networks and networks with packet-loss.},

The real-time solution of such a problem, formulated in the framework of optimal control theory, is a challenging issue. We prove that a real-time solution of the constrained motion planning problem for multibody systems is possible for practical real-life applications on standard personal computers. The proposed method is based on an indirect approach that eliminates the inequalities via penalty formulation and solves the boundary value problem by a combination of finite differences and Newton-Broyden algorithm. Two application examples are presented to validate the method and for performance comparisons. Numerical results show that the approach is real-time capable if the correct penalty formulation and settings are chosen. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.},

@article{Dolgov2010,
	abstract = {We describe a practical path-planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle operating in an unknown semi-structured (or unstructured) environment, where obstacles are detected online by the robot's sensors. This work was motivated by and experimentally validated in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, where robotic vehicles had to autonomously navigate parking lots. The core of our approach to path planning consists of two phases. The first phase uses a variant of A* search (applied to the 3D kinematic state space of the vehicle) to obtain a kinematically feasible trajectory. The second phase then improves the quality of the solution via numeric non-linear optimization, leading to a local (and frequently global) optimum. Further, we extend our algorithm to use prior topological knowledge of the environment to guide path planning, leading to faster search and final trajectories better suited to the structure of the environment. We present experimental results from the DARPA Urban Challenge, where our robot demonstrated near-flawless performance in complex general path-planning tasks such as navigating parking lots and executing U-turns on blocked roads. We also present results on autonomous navigation of real parking lots. In those latter tasks, which are significantly more complex than the ones in the DARPA Urban Challenge, the time of a full replanning cycle of our planner is in the range of 50---300 ms.},

@article{Richards2002,
	abstract = {This paper introduces a method for finding fuel-optimal$\backslash$ntrajectories for spacecraft subject to avoidance$\backslash$nrequirements. These include avoidance of collisions with$\backslash$nobstacles or other vehicles and prevention of thruster$\backslash$nplumes from one spacecraft impinging upon another$\backslash$nspacecraft or obstacle. The necessary logical constraints$\backslash$nfor avoidance are appended to a fuel-optimizing linear$\backslash$nprogram by including binary variables in the$\backslash$noptimization. The resulting problem is a mixed-integer$\backslash$nlinear program (MILP) that can be solved using available$\backslash$nsoftware. The logical constraints can also be used to$\backslash$nexpress the configuration requirements for maneuvers$\backslash$nwhere only the final relative alignment of the vehicles$\backslash$nis important, and the assignment of spacecraft within the$\backslash$nfleet is not specified. The collision avoidance,$\backslash$ntrajectory optimization, and fleet assignment problems$\backslash$ncan be combined into a single MILP to obtain the optimal$\backslash$nsolution for these maneuvers. The paper presents the MILP$\backslash$nproblem formulation, including these various avoidance$\backslash$nconstraints, and then shows several examples of their$\backslash$napplication to spacecraft maneuvers, including$\backslash$nreconfiguration of a satellite formation and close$\backslash$ninspection of the International Space Station by a$\backslash$nmicrosatellite. These examples clearly show that the$\backslash$ntrajectory design methods presented in this paper are$\backslash$nparticularly well suited for proposed formation flying$\backslash$nmissions that involve multiple vehicles operating in$\backslash$nclose proximity.},

@article{Smith2011,
	abstract = {In this paper we present a method for automatically generating optimal robot paths satisfying high-level mission specifications. The motion of the robot in the environment is modeled as a weighted transition system. The mission is specified by an arbitrary linear temporal-logic (LTL) formula over propositions satisfied at the regions of a partitioned environment. The mission specification contains an optimizing proposition, which must be repeatedly satisfied. The cost function that we seek to minimize is the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition. For every environment model, and for every formula, our method computes a robot path that minimizes the cost function. The problem is motivated by applications in robotic monitoring and data-gathering. In this setting, the optimizing proposition is satisfied at all locations where data can be uploaded, and the LTL formula specifies a complex data-collection mission. Our method utilizes B{\"{u}}chi automata to produce an automaton (which can be thought of as a graph) whose runs satisfy the temporal-logic specification. We then present a graph algorithm that computes a run corresponding to the optimal robot path. We present an implementation for a robot performing data collection in a road-network platform. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications 2011.},

@article{Sim2004,
	abstract = {Tremendous progress has been made recently in simultaneous localization and mapping of unknown environments. Using sensor and odometry data from an exploring mobile robot, it has become much easier to build high-quality globally consistent maps of many large, real-world environments. To date, however, relatively little attention has been paid to the controllers used to build these maps. Existing exploration strategies usually attempt to cover the largest amount of unknown space as quickly as possible. Few strategies exist for building the most reliable map possible, but the particular control strategy can have a substantial impact on the quality of the resulting map. In this paper, we devise a control algorithm for exploring unknown space that explicitly tries to build as large a map as possible while maintaining as accurate a map as possible. We make use of a parameterized class of spiral trajectory policies, choosing a new parameter setting at every time step to maximize the expected reward of the policy. We do this in the context of building a visual map of an unknown environment, and show that our strategy leads to a higher accuracy map faster than other candidate controllers, including any single choice in our policy class.},

While statistical inference techniques have led to computationally efficient mapping algorithms, the next major challenge in robotic mapping is to automate the data collection process. In this paper, we address the problem of how a robot should plan to explore an unknown environment and collect data in order to maximize the accuracy of the resulting map. We formulate exploration as a constrained optimization problem and use reinforcement learning to find trajectories that lead to accurate maps. We demonstrate this process in simulation and show that the learned policy not only results in improved map building, but that the learned policy also transfers successfully to a real robot exploring on MIT campus.},

Like CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning), our algorithm can be used to find collision-free trajectories from na{\"{i}}ve, straight-line initializations that might be in collision. At the core of our approach are (a) a sequential convex optimization procedure, which penalizes collisions with a hinge loss and increases the penalty coefficients in an outer loop as necessary, and (b) an efficient formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly considers continuous-time safety Our algorithm is implemented in a software package called TrajOpt.We report results from a series of experiments comparing TrajOpt with CHOMP and randomized planners from OMPL, with regard to planning time and path quality. We consider motion planning for 7 DOF robot arms, 18 DOF full-body robots, statically stable walking motion for the 34 DOF Atlas humanoid robot, and physical experiments with the 18 DOF PR2. We also apply TrajOpt to plan curvature-constrained steerable needle trajectories in the SE(3) configuration space and multiple non-intersecting curved channels within 3D-printed implants for intracavitary brachytherapy.

@article{Gonzalez2016,
	abstract = {---Intelligent vehicles have increased their capabilities for highly and, even fully, automated driving under controlled environments. Scene information is received using onboard sen-sors and communication network systems, i.e., infrastructure and other vehicles. Considering the available information, different motion planning and control techniques have been implemented to autonomously driving on complex environments. The main goal is focused on executing strategies to improve safety, comfort, and energy optimization. However, research challenges such as navi-gation in urban dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance capabilities, i.e., vulnerable road users (VRU) and vehicles, and cooperative maneuvers among automated and semi-automated vehicles still need further efforts for a real environment implemen-tation. This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques implemented in the intelligent vehicles literature. A description of the technique used by research teams, their contributions in motion planning, and a comparison among these techniques is also presented. Relevant works in the overtaking and obstacle avoidance maneuvers are presented, allowing the understanding of the gaps and challenges to be addressed in the next years. Finally, an overview of future research direction and applications is given.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely employed in ocean survey, monitoring, and search and rescue tasks for both civil and military applications. It is beneficial to use multiple AUVs that perform environmental sampling and sensing tasks for the purposes of efficiency and cost effectiveness. In this paper, an adaptive path planning algorithm is proposed for multiple AUVs to estimate the scalar field over a region of interest. In the proposed method, a measurable model composed of multiple basis functions is defined to represent the scalar field. A selective basis function Kalman filter is developed to achieve model estimation through the information collected by multiple AUVs. In addition, a path planning method, the multidimensional rapidly exploring random trees star algorithm, which uses mutual information, is proposed for the multi-AUV system. Employing the path planning algorithm, the sampling positions of the AUVs are determined to improve the quality of future samples by maximizing the mutual information between the scalar field model and observations. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, an indoor experiment using four robotic fishes is carried out to validate the algorithms presented.},

Temporal logic specifications can capture the usual control specifications such as reachability and invariance as well as more complex specifications like sequencing and obstacle avoidance. Our approach consists of three basic steps. First, we design a control law that enables the dynamic model to track a simpler kinematic model with a globally bounded error. Second, we built a robust temporal logic specification that takes into account the tracking errors of the first step. Finally, we solve the new robust temporal logic path planning problem for the kinematic model using automata theory and simple local vector fields.

This paper addresses the DKF problem by reducing it to two separate dynamic consensus problems in terms of weighted measurements and inverse-covariance matrices. These to data fusion problems are solved is a distributed way using low-pass and band-pass consensus filters. Consensus filters are distributed algorithms that allow calculation of average-consensus of time-varying signals. The stability properties of consensus filters is discussed in a companion CDC '05 paper [24]. We show that a central Kalman filter for sensor networks can be decomposed into n micro-Kalman filters with inputs that are provided by two types of consensus filters. This network of micro-Kalman filters collectively are capable to provide an estimate of the state of the process (under observation) that is identical to the estimate obtained by a central Kalman filter given that all nodes agree on two central sums. Later, we demonstrate that our consensus filters can approximate these sums and that gives an approximate distributed Kalman filtering algorithm. A detailed account of the computational and communication architecture of the algorithm is provided. Simulation results are presented for a sensor network with 200 nodes and more than 1000 links.},
