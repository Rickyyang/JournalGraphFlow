\setcounter{proposition}{2}
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:HProperty}
 {\news The matrix $H$ has the following properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{it:rotation} It is a rotation, i.e. (a) $H\transpose H=I$; (b) $\det(H)=1$
  % \begin{enumerate}
  %   \item\label{it:orthonormality} $H\transpose H=I$;
  %   \item\label{it:determinant} $\det(H)=1$.
  %   \end{enumerate}
  \item\label{it:transformation} $\nu_2=H \nu_1$.
  \end{enumerate}}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
 {\news For subclaim~\ref{it:rotation}a,  since $u\transpose u=1$:
  \begin{equation}
    H\transpose H=H^2=4uu\transpose u u\transpose - 4uu\transpose +I^2=I.

1. There still are some typos, eg., 

   a) in Fig 4, the legend is Region 1 and Region 2, but in the text,
you use Zone1 and Zone2.

   b) Sec 2D, first paragraph, $q^{\epsilon} \in F^{\epsilon}$?
	\re All typos mentioned have been fixed.

\textbf{Section II.D}

\newcommand{\oFE}{o}
To use the definition of reachability ellipsoid from the section above as computational constraints for ADMM, we first apply a differentiable rigid body transformation to reposition the ellipse $\cE$ from the global frame $\cF$ to a canonical frame $\cF_\cE$, where the origin of $\cF_\cE$ is at the ellipsoid's center $\oFE = \frac{1}{2}(q_1+q_2)$, and the first axis of $\cF_\cE$ is aligned with the foci (see \cref{fig:EllipseConstraintExample} for an illustration). 
From this definition, a unit vector along the first axis of the ellipsoid in the frames $\cF$ and $\cF_\cE$ is given by $\nu_\cF = \frac{q_2-q_1}{\norm{q_2-q_1}}$ and $\nu_\cE =[1,0,0]^T$, respectively.
The full transformation from coordinates \new{$q^\cE\in\cF_\cE$} to $q\in\cF$, and its inverse, are then parametrized by a rotation $R^\cF_\cE$ and a translation $o^\cF_\cE$ as (we drop the subscript and superscript from $R^\cF_\cE$ and $o^\cF_\cE$ to simplify the notation):\setcounter{figure}{3}

\textbf{Section II.H}

The simulation result, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ReachabilitySimulation}, displays reachability regions as black ellipsoids, demonstrating empty intersections with \new{region} 2 and 3. Explicit constraints between reachability regions and obstacles are not activated, assuming basic obstacle avoidance capabilities in robots. The intersections between obstacles and ellipsoids, as observed between agent 3 and \new{region} 1, are deemed tolerable. All constraints are satisfied, and agents have effectively spread across the map for optimal exploration tasks.

	2. In algorithm 1, what is the reason for using $t_0 + 1$ and $t_2 - 1$? 
	
	3. In Fig 5, no explanation is made in the caption
\re The algorithm aims to find the furthest waypoint such that the reachability region between waypoint at $t_0$ and a later waypoint that does not intersect with any forbidden region. Since evaluating the reachability region between the same waypoint (e.g., $t_0$ to $t_0$) is not meaningful, we exclude such cases and begin the search from $t_0 +1$ The same logic applies in the reverse direction, where we stop at $t_2 -1$ instead of including $t_2$. For better readability, we reorder the sequence of the variables ($v_0$ to $v_3$) and add additional indicator in the illustration figure (Fig.5).
